# CUSTOMIZING WINDOWS 10 FOR SCREEN DISPLAY

1. Disable the taskbar by installing [Taskbar Hider](TaskbarHider/TaskBarHider.exe).
 - Run as Administrator.
 - Set it up to launch on startup, and choose 'Ctrl+Shift+Z' as the shortcut.

2. Turn off all notifications in the Action Center.
 - See [this article](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-configure-notifications-action-center-windows-10/) for a guide on how to do this.

3. Run the registry files in the Registry folder by double-clicking them.
 - [DisableWin10Swiping.reg](Registry/DisableWin10Swiping.reg) disables edge swipe gestures, the action center, etc.

4. Turn off Touch Actions in Pen and Touch settings.
 - Open Start menu, start typing 'Pen and Touch'.
 - In the Pen and Touch dialog, click 'Settings...' for 'Press and Hold' and disable it.
 - Turn off 'Show visual feedback when touching the screen'  (if desired.)
